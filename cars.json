            "desc": "The Pagani Huayra is an Italian mid-engined sports car produced by Pagani. Succeeding the company's previous offering, the Zonda, it costs €1,198,000 ($1,314,000), (£910,905).",
            "text": "The Huayra uses a twin-turbo, V12 engine developed by Mercedes-AMG specially for the Huayra. The Huayra's 6.0-litre engine, the M158, produces 730 metric horsepower (720 bhp (539 kW)) and 811 lb·ft (1,100 N·m) of torque. Its top speed is about 238 mph (383 km/h) and it has a rating 0–62 miles per hour (0–100 km/h) acceleration time of 2.8 seconds. Using Pirelli tires, the Pagani Huayra is capable of withstanding 1.66 g of lateral acceleration at speeds of up to 230 mph (370 km/h). The Pagani Huayra uses a seven-speed sequential gearbox and a single disc clutch. The choice not to use a dual-clutch in an oil bath was due to the increase in weight of over 70 kg (154 lb), thus negating any advantage of the faster gear changes in a double-clutch transmission. As a result, the entire transmission weighs 96 kg (212 lb). The car is equipped with Brembo brake calipers, rotors and pads. The calipers have four pistons in front and four in the rear. The rotors are drilled carbon ceramic, 380 mm (15.0 in) in diameter and 34 mm (1.3 in) thick."

            "desc": "The Toyota Vitz is a line of three- and five-door hatchback subcompact cars produced since 1998 by the Japanese automobile manufacturer Toyota.",
            "text": "The first generation XP10 series Toyota Vitz was designed by Sotiris Kovos at Toyota's ED2 studio in Europe. Production began in late 1998, with a Japanese on-sale date of January 1999; European sales commenced two months later as the 'Toyota Yaris'. When introduced to Australasia in October 1999, the 'Toyota Echo' name was used, as was the case in Canada when released there in 2003 for the 2004 model year. The 'Echo' and 'Yaris' names were also given to the export version of the related Japanese market Toyota Platz sedan, also available as a coupe in North America. Often sold alongside the hatchback and marketed as a single line of vehicles, exterior panels common between the Vitz and Platz were restricted to the front doors. However, as Vitz and Platz were designed using the same platform, the mechanicals are largely identical and both share a common dashboard module. There was also a 'Yaris Verso' or 'Echo Verso' variant sold in some export markets from late 1999, based on the Japanese 'Toyota Fun Cargo'. The Verso MPV utilizes the same running gear as the Vitz, but features a more spacious interior."
